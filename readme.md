# Password Manager 

Hi all, this project is my side project for password management.

For the backend side I used .Net as framework and also use both MySql and Vault to stored the password for each domains.

For the frontend side I had write a script of [TemperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), which can refer the file in `TempermonkeyScripts/`
